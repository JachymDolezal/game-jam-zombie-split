# ZombieSplit

Made in Godot by Jachym Dolezal for Gamejam 2023 help by VUT FIT (introduction to gamedevelopment)
- theme: separate and join

## About

The main idea is that the player plays as a Zombie which can split into its legs and body. Each body part can be controlled on its own. Each body part has its own jumping height and speed. There are traps that can kill the zombie and the player has to use the split ability to solve small puzzles and get all meat pieces. It has potential for a logical puzzle game.
